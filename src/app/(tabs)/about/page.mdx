# Hi, I'm Gaurav

I work as a frontend engineer at [Zepto](https://www.zepto.com). I like building things for the web and occasionally writing about stuff I learn along the way.

## A bit about me

I'm from Kullu, a small town in Himachal Pradesh. Got interested in computers pretty early – started messing around with websites in 9th grade when I made a blog on Blogger. I didn't really know what I was doing, but it was fun.

Tried learning Android development in school but my laptop couldn't handle Android Studio. Attempted Python too, got stuck on OOP concepts for way too long. The usual beginner struggles.

Did my BTech in Computer Science from LPU (2018-2022). Spent a lot of time on competitive programming during college – nothing impressive, but it helped me get better at problem-solving. During COVID, I finally got into web development and that's what stuck.

## These days

Mostly working with React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I've been getting into web performance lately – it's one of those rabbit holes you can keep going deeper into. Outside of work, I'm usually just browsing the internet or trying to cook something edible.
