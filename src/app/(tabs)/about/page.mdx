I'm a software engineer with a passion for web applications. I currently work at Zepto, mostly focusing on web performance and improving the overall user experience. Before this, I worked at JioMart.

I’m always trying to learn and get better at what I do. A lot of my time goes into understanding how things work, fixing issues, and paying attention to small details that make a difference over time.

This space is a mix of everything I care about. I write about frontend engineering and performance, but also share thoughts from work, life, and things I’m learning along the way.

## A bit about me

I’m from Kullu, a small town in Himachal Pradesh. I got curious about computers pretty early, mostly wondering how websites show up on Google and how people build them. That curiosity led me to create my own blog. I didn’t understand much back then, but curiosity is what kept pushing me forward.

I did my BTech in Computer Science from LPU between 2018 and 2022. I spent a good amount of time on competitive programming during college. While I didn’t achieve much, it helped me build a stronger approach to problem-solving.

I also tried Android development at different points, but my laptop couldn’t really handle Android Studio, so that didn’t go very far. During COVID, I started spending more time learning web development. Since then, web development has been my main focus.

Mostly working with React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I've been getting into web performance lately – it's one of those rabbit holes you can keep going deeper into.
