Like every year, 2025 went by very fast. It feels like it was January just a few months ago.
Now that the year is almost over, I thought I should write about how the year went.
Looking back, I can say that I did a lot this year. So let’s go through it.

### Health

This year, I reached the best shape of my life so far. I lost around 5 kg of weight and moved from 80 kg to ~75 kg.

I also started running this year. In the beginning, I used to run around the lake near my house in Bangalore. One lap of the lake is around 1.3 km, and at first I could only complete one lap.
Slowly, I moved to two laps. Around that time, one of my colleagues, who is very good at running, gave me a simple piece of advice. He told me to slow down and increase the distance. This advice helped me a lot over time.

Gradually, I was able to run 5 km, which once felt impossible to me. My average pace is around 7 minutes 19 seconds per kilometer. On good days, I am also able to run 10 km at a similar pace.
I have not participated in any marathon yet, but running a 10 km race is something I want to do in the future.

Running played a big role in my weight loss, along with regular strength training. For most of the year, I made sure to go to the gym at least four to five days a week.
I saw a clear improvement in my strength and was able to hit a few personal records. For example, I reached 60 kg on the bench press and 60 kg on squats. Gym and running are habits I want to continue in 2026 as well.

This year, I also focused a lot on eating clean and balanced food. For most of the year, I ate the same breakfast every day. It included soaked oats with seeds, a scoop of whey protein, and some fruits.
This gave me more than 45 grams of protein in my first meal. I also made sure to avoid eating too much sugar.
