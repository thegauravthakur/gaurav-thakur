Like every year, 2025 went by very fast. It feels like it was January just a few months ago.
Now that the year is almost over, I thought I should write about how the year went.
Looking back, I can say that I did a lot this year. So let’s go through it.

### Health

This year, I reached the best shape of my life so far. I lost around 5 kg of weight and moved from 80 kg to ~75 kg.

I also started running this year. In the beginning, I used to run around the lake near my house in Bangalore. One lap of the lake is around 1.3 km, and at first I could only complete one lap.
Slowly, I moved to two laps. Around that time, one of my colleagues, who is very good at running, gave me a simple piece of advice. He told me to <Highlight>slow down and increase the distance</Highlight>. This advice helped me a lot over time.

Gradually, I was able to run 5 km, which once felt impossible to me. My average pace is around 7 minutes 19 seconds per kilometer. On good days, I am also able to run 10 km at a similar pace.
I have not participated in any marathon yet, but running a 10 km race is something I want to do in the future.

Running played a big role in my weight loss, along with regular strength training. For most of the year, I made sure to go to the gym at least four to five days a week.
I saw a clear improvement in my strength and was able to hit a few personal records. For example, I reached 60 kg on the bench press and 60 kg on squats. Gym and running are habits I want to continue in 2026 as well.

This year, I also focused a lot on eating clean and balanced food. For most of the year, I ate the same breakfast every day. It included soaked oats with seeds, a scoop of whey protein, and some fruits.
This gave me more than 45 grams of protein in my first meal. I also made sure to avoid eating too much sugar.

### New Bike

I had been riding my scooty in Bangalore for the last one or two years after bringing it from my hometown when I moved here.
It served me well and never gave me any trouble.

But for a long time, I had wanted to get myself a bike. I was a big fan of the Royal Enfield Classic 350. I took test rides of almost all the popular bikes in the 350–650 cc range
and was very close to buying the Classic 350.

Then I heard that Royal Enfield was going to launch the Classic 650. The pictures looked stunning, so I decided to wait. Once it was available,
I took a test ride, loved it, and booked the bike. I’ll probably be among the first few owners of this beauty.

The bike is heavy, and riding it in Bangalore’s traffic can be tough at times. But as my friend rightly said, <Highlight>when something is this beautiful, you have to put up with a few tantrums</Highlight>.
